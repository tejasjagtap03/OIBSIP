            <p>The man of honesty 
                The man of Greatness He is our Mahatma
                The father of our nation!
                Born in a 
                Of Cultured background
                Grown in a circle
                Of Loving parents.
                Honest, truthful and simple
                Of body so frail yet nimble
                With heart so big and true
                With gifts but given to few.
                Made many mistakes
                Realized his faults
                Vowed never to repeat them
                And never committed them again.
                Loved his motherland
                Brought her freedom
                With the weapon of non-violence
                And not a drop of blood-shed.
                Bravely to prison he went
                Though old and bent
                Many a blow did he get
                Yet never did he fret.
                With guns and knives, he did not fight
                Satyagraha was his eternal might
                India's independence he fought and won
                Bloodshed and bitterness there was none.
                Adopted penance and fasting
                Started the Satyagraha
                Gave up foreign goods
                And inspired wearing Khadi.

                    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist <br>and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful <br>campaign for India's independence from British. He inspired movements for civil<br> rights and freedom across the world.<br> The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied <br>to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.
                    <br>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law <br> at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. <br>After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful  law <br> practice,he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a <br>lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi <br>raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil <br>rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants,<br> farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.
